# Learning:
# In this project, I learned how to use the SpellChecker library to identify and correct misspelled words in a given text.
# The program splits the input text into individual words, checks each word for spelling errors, and suggests corrections
# in this i learn about SpellChecker Library and its functions like correction() and how to implement it in a class structure.
