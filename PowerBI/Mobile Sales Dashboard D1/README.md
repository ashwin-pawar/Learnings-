# 📊 Mobile Sales Dashboard | Power BI Project

This project showcases a **Comprehensive Mobile Sales Dashboard** built in Microsoft Power BI.  

It focuses on analyzing sales performance using **Month-To-Date (MTD)** and **Same Period Last Year (SPLY)** metrics to evaluate growth and business trends.

The dashboard uses a **modern, rounded-card design** with clean visuals and balanced colors for a professional look.
