Welcome All 

Here, I upload all my practice and real-world projects where I learn something new, experiment with data, and refine my analytical skills.

📁 Inside this folder, you’ll find:

📈 Interactive visualizations and dashboards

🧠 My learnings, experiments, and insights

💼 Both small practice tasks and real-world projects

🛠️ Explorations using Power BI, Python, Excel, and more

Every project here represents a step forward in my data analytics journey — from exploring raw data to turning it into meaningful insights. 🌟
