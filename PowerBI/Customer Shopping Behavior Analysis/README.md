# 🛍️ End to End Data Analysis Project - Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview
This is the end to end Project of Data Analysis.  
In this Project i make used of **Python (Pandas)** on **Jupyter Notebook** where i did quick **Data Cleaning**, **EDA**, and some **Transformation** like adding new features such as new columns.  

Then i connected my Jupyter Notebook with **PgAdmin** in which i make used of **PostgreSQL** for solving some business problems and finding insights.  

After that, for **Visualization** and creating an **interactive dashboard**, i opened **Power BI Desktop** and connected my PgAdmin database with Power BI and then i created a dashboard after a lot of time in adjusting, thinking, and other.
