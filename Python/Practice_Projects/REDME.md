In this project, I invested a significant amount of time and effort. Although the code may seem simple and short, I faced many challenges along the way, such as handling negative values, fixing indentation errors, and other unexpected issues. At times, it was frustrating and even made me consider giving up. However, I persevered, and the result you see here is the outcome of my persistence and determination.

After building this project, I was able to strengthen and refine my fundamental skills in loops, flow control statements, logic building, and problem-solving. Additionally, I learned the importance of patience while working through challenges in a project.
